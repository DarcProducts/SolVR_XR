  facts: "FUN FACTS:\n\n1. Mars is also known as the Red Planet. This is because
    Mars is covered in soil, rock, and dust made from iron oxide which gives the
    surface a red rusty colour.\r\n\n2. Mars is named after the Roman god of war.\r\n\n3.
    Mars has 2 moons called Deimos and Phobos. They are named after the two horses
    that pull the Roman god of war, Mars\u2019, chariot. They may be asteroids captured
    by Mars\u2019 gravity.\r\n\n4. Mars is the 4th planet from the sun. It is 227,936,637
    km (141 million miles) away from the sun. It would take 300 days (around 8 months)
    to get there from Earth.\r\n\n5. Mars is smaller than Earth with a diameter of
    4217 miles. This makes it the second smallest planet in our solar system.\r\n\n6.
    A day on Mars lasts 24 hours and 37 minutes.\r\n\n7. One year on Mars is 687
    days long. That\u2019s 1.9 Earth years. This is because Mars is further away
    from the sun so it takes longer to orbit it.\r\n\n8. The tilt on the axis of
    Mars is 25 degrees which means that the planet experiences seasons like we do
    on Earth as different parts of the planet are closer to the sun at different
    times of its orbit.\r\n\n9. Mars has a thin atmosphere made from 95.9% carbon
    dioxide and 2.7% nitrogen. The atmosphere is so thin that it\u2019s not thick
    enough to trap the sun\u2019s heat so it is very cold - ranging from -100\u2103
    in winter to 20\u2103  in summer.\r\n\n10. Mars has very weak gravity. Gravity
    on Mars is 37% less than on Earth. This means that on Mars you could jump 3x
    higher than on Earth."
